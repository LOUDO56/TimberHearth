# TimberHearth
Sync your Minecraft world time with the Timber Hearth OST, just like in Outer Wilds!

The music lasts 3m24s, so with this mod, a day lasts 3m24s instead of 10 minutes, and the same goes for the night.

When it starts raining, the music volume fades out. When the rain stops, the music fades back in. The same happens when you enter a cave.

If you like Outer Wilds, you might like this mod :p
